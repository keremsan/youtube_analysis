You can either create the top entirely out of hot glue or follow Sue's example and use little seashells and a ribbon as the base. \n\nTurn your doll into the most beautiful mermaid ever!\n\nCheck out more mermaid videos on our channel:\n\nL.O.L. doll into a mermaid https://youtu.be/fwujtuORUM0\n\nA glittery snow globe with Ariel inside https://youtu.be/scJB5TYM6MY\n\nThis video has English subtitles for your convenience!\n\nCheck out Slime Sam's Community Tab and see his best pictures, funny GIFs, new episode announcements and much more! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community\n\nSubscribe to Sam's channel and give a thumbs up to motivate him to make more videos for you! https://goo.gl/zarVZo\n\n- - -\nStock materials:\nhttps://www.depositphotos.com\n- - -\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/\nOPENING THEME is licensed under MUSIC STANDARD LICENSE:\nTitle: Cuckoo\nSource: https://audiojungle.net/item/cuckoo/20801073"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT9M29S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "4804408", "likeCount": "60910", "dislikeCount": "5331", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}, "recordingDetails": {"locationDescription": "USA", "location": {"latitude": 37.09024, "longitude": -95.712891, "altitude": 0}}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "oUmi_XrnZDfTbVs2nBg0Z36TD5g", "id": "Lk9TEgh7eoY", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-10-06T12:27:58Z", "channelId": "UCEjA5F8lg5ntTbS7WDeRDFA", "title": "How to Build a Modern Secret Underground Base", "description": "How to Build a Modern Secret Underground Base - 1\n\nMr.Heang Update: I am from United States of America (USA).

It smells like cotton candy... Oh! It's a whole bunch of Candylocks dolls! Slime Sam brought his friend Sue a box full of them!\n\nCandylocks are scented collectible dolls full of surprises! Every girl has 15 inches of super soft colorful hair that looks just like cotton candy! You won't know which doll is inside until you unwrap her hair.\n\nThe dolls come with 6 hair accessories to customize their look - a hair twirler, 3 hair gems and 2 hair pin . And it's so easy to style their hair, because the hair texture holds its shape and doesn\u2019t come apart.

But her friend slime Sam is too bored to wait for his turn. So he steals all the Spirograph parts from Sue. It's a good thing that Sue knows how to make crafts from cardboard. So she simply builds a drawing machine from scratch!\n\nThis machine doesn't need electricity. To make it, you'll need thick cardboard, bearings, wooden rulers, bolts and nuts, wooden sticks and hot glue to put it all together. The main mechanism of this machine are three large gears.

I looked at 32 cheapest countries that are on multiple lists of best countries to retire, and after examining all the costs, health care, safety, entertainment, and ease of getting a visa.  I have come up with a list of the 5 best countries that you should consider moving to if you want to live well on $1000 per month or less.  \n#arvinash\n#moneymondays\nGoing abroad can be scary, because of the many unknowns and questions that come to mind, such as 1) Will I have to learn another language 2) Will it be safe 3) What are the visa requirement for 4) Which city should I live in 5) What will I need to budget.\n\nHere are the 5 best, safest, and cheapest countries in alphabetical order:\n\nBolivia is probably the cheapest place to live in South America. Bolivia has the largest Native American population in South America. Farming is the main occupation of Bolivians. Cochabamba is a popular choice among expats who want a slow lifestyle and access to some of the comforts of home. Not only is the food affordable, but also healthcare and the real estate. You can live in a detached house for $500 a month in rent. The main drawback to Bolivia is that you will need to learn Spanish to get around, as English is not widely spoken. To retire here, you\u2019ll need to apply for something called a \"specific purpose visa.\"  at a cost of $160. They also require a letter stating your intentions, proof of your financial situation, and a police record check. You can usually renew the visa every two or five-years depending on type. \n\nCambodia will allow you to upgrade your lifestyle to luxurious on a modest budget. There are lots of Western influences for foods to restaurants to movies. You can have a house cleaner that costs $40 per month. The city Siem Reap in northwestern Cambodia would be a good choice. It is easy to get around here, especially on a motorbike, and most places have reliable Wi-Fi. Another big advantage to Siem Reap is that English is widely understood and spoken here. Beware that Siem Reap can get hot, so if that\u2019s something you can\u2019t stand, then avoid this place.  If you want to move here, you will need to apply for a business visa at a cost of $35.  Once you have this you can extend it on an ongoing basis indefinitely.\n\nNicaragua is the largest nation in land size in Central America. There\u2019s great health care, little traffic, warm people and a low cost of living. Nicaragua has beaches, colonial towns, jungles, and bustling city centers. If you are a surfer, you will have some of the best waves in the world. You\u2019re not going to do much better than Nicaragua in the Americas.It is going to be helpful for you to speak English. But many Expats prefer to live in Grenada and San Juan del Sur, where locals speak some English. As a retiree, any money earned outside of Nicaragua is tax-free. And you can get a residency visa for 5 years with the ability to renew. So there is no checking in required every month.\n\nPhillippines is perhaps the cheapest English-speaking country in the world.  English is widely spoken and understood here, so is great for those that don\u2019t want to learn a new language. Manilla is one of the biggest and most traffic choked cities in the world, so it may be a part of the country you want to avoid.  Tagaytay is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Philippines and actually, it\u2019s not so expensive to live there.  Taal Lake, you can live in a spot where vacationers go. If you want to move here, you will have to get a Special Resident Retiree visa or SRRV. For people 50 or older, they require a deposit of $10,000 in a Phillipine bank, but that money can be used towards an apartment with a minimum price of $50,000. And you have to show that you have a monthly pension of at least $1000. But this visa will allow you to stay as long as you want, and travel in and out of the country freely.\n\nVietnam \nHo Chi Minh City is now a real hotbed. There is cheap rent, fast internet, great food and cheap beer. You can live here on a tourist visa more easily and cheaply than in Thailand. If you live outside the two largest cities, in places like Da Nang or Hoi An, prices will be much lower, but will have fewer Western amenities. Da Nang is the third-largest city in Vietnam, and it is the designated tourism jewel of Vietnam, with several UNESCO World Heritage sites. English is spoken and understood by most residents. Vietnamese health care is good for basic needs, but the country doesn\u2019t score high for specialized care or surgeries. If you want to move here, Vietnam doesn\u2019t have a retirement visa, but U.S. citizens can get a one-year multiple-entry visa that will have to be renewed. The big drawback is that It requires that you leave the country once every 90 days. Most foreigners take a trip abroad\u2014a \u201cvisa run\u201d\u2014before their current visa expires. You can make an unlimited number of visa runs.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXf38mC3puE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXf38mC3puE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXf38mC3puE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXf38mC3puE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXf38mC3puE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Arvin Ash", "tags": ["cheapest places to live in the world", "cheapest countries to live", "cheapest countries to retire", "best countries to retire", "best countries to live in", "Bolivia", "Nicaragua", "Phillipines", "Cambodia", "Vietnam", "how to live on 1000 a month", "arvin ash", "money mondays", "retirement", "retiring cheap", "retirement abroad"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Cheapest Countries to live | Living on 1000 a month LUXURIOUSLY", "description": "What are Cheapest places and best places to live in the world on $1000 per month?

These fish are prehistoric and have been around since the dinosaurs! Kyle aka \u201cThe Fish Whisperer,\u201d Henry Martin from Catching Dinosaurs, and I went searching on a river for a monster 200lb alligator gar. I used a drone to help search for these giant fish on the surface. Immediately, we spotted a giant garfish swimming twenty feet from the bank. We pitched a filet of carp to the fish, and it ate grabbed it! I fought the fish for about thirty seconds before it managed to get dehooked. Shortly after we spotted another big gar on the surface with the drone. The giant fish ate the bait right beside the boat! I fought the fish for about ten minutes before we landed it at the bank. This fish was a new personal record!! We quickly removed the hook and released the fish. Later in the day, I spotted another giant gar on the surface. Kyle wanted to catch the fish using a topwater lure. He threw the yellow lure behind the shrub where the fish sat, and within a few seconds of twitching the bait, the gar swam up and smashed it!! Unfortunately, Kyle lost the fish. We hooked a few more gar on lures and then decided to call it a day. The next morning we headed out to the mouth of the river and used a different technique, soaking baits. After a few hours, I hooked the first long-nosed gar of the trip, and shortly after another alligator gar using cut baits on the bottom. Texas was a blast, and we caught some giant fish, but the quest for a 200lb alligator gar continues!\n\n\u25bc BlacktipH Products:\nhttp://bit.ly/blacktiph-shop\n\n\u25bc Subscribe to The Fish Whisperer:\nhttp://bit.ly/fishwhisperer-subscribe\n\n\u25bc Catching Dinosaurs with Henry Martin:\n\u2022 Follow Greg on Instagram \u2192 @catchingdinosaurs\n\u2022 Facebook: http://bit.ly/catching-dinosaurs-FB\n\n\u25bc To learn more about the species of fish caught in this video, click the links below: \n\n\u2022 Alligator Gar \u2192 http://bit.ly/alligator-gar-info\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac ABOUT BLACKTIPH \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nBlacktipH Fishing brings you some of the most exciting fishing videos on the web.

For challenge #2, I traveled to Lakeside Grill in Ponca City, Oklahoma (1 hour north of Oklahoma City) and took on their undefeated French Fry \"Lake Monster\" Burger Challenge. It is called Lakeside Grill because they are right next to Lake Ponca. There were four 1/2 lb beef burger patties stacked and layered with cheese, bacon, french fries, and slices of Texas toast. TWO full baskets of their hand-cut fries surrounded the burger, and there was a 1 hour time limit to finish everything. Over 22 people had previously failed this undefeated burger challenge. BIG thanks to Toby (an owner) and everyone with Lakeside Grill for the wonderful food and hospitality, and to all the many people who came up to watch and meet me that afternoon.

This project is simple & easy to do. You can use this to display your holiday or fall decor this season. After several requests, I looked around online at what was trending, modern, and with an elegant twist, this is what I came up with. This can be recreated to match any style decor but of course, I did mine in bling and glam. This table is far and away my new favorite addition to my room decor. Everything you need to recreate this can be found at Dollar Tree but I do use a couple of upgrade options that are the same cost.\n\nSubscribe to Creative Living Lifestyles for More \n https://www.youtube.com/c/CreativeLiving?SUB_CONFIRMATION=1\n\nMaterials used\n6 - long 11x3 canvases\n4 - wooden decor boxes (prefer pop up) \n2- 8x10 silver frames\n2 - 5x7 silver frames\nAdhesive bling wrap or mosaic mirrors \n1-inch craft mirrors (optional) \n1 or 2 - 4x6 picture frames with an easel in the back. (4 inches) you can cut two of the 6 inches to make 4 inches or purchase 2 frames. \n\nThe materials I used I had on hand and were leftovers from previous projects. Feel free to substitute and use anything you have on hand that works for this DIY. \n\nThe mosaic mirrors I still haven't found myself at Dollar Tree. The ones I order from Amazon are here - 3600 Pc mosaic mirror https://amzn.to/2JKv049\n\nI also used picture frame pieces leftover from previous projects. \n\nMIRROR DETAILS -  \nI used a 12x20 inch beveled mirror from Micheal's. I looked on their website and the cost is $8.00. After I used a 50% off coupon I pulled up on my phone while in the check out line I paid just over four dollars. They currently have a 60% off coupon and always have at least a 40% - 50% they offer on their website. To me I think this is the better quality for the same money but if you don't have a Micheal's nearby you can use Dollar Tree's 5x7 mirrors and it turns out to be super close to the same size as the mirror I used in this DIY. I have a project where I attached 4 of these mirrors together creating a vanity tray. Here is the link if you prefer this method rather than the large beveled mirror https://youtu.be/Myk12XyNPno\nAlso another option I mentioned in the video is for an even bigger tabletop you could connect 4 of their 8x10 mirrors. Something I didn't mention is you can custom make your tabletop to any size using their small 5x5 square mirrors. That would be the more costly route but it is an option. All these costs about the same thing so it's all about whatever you like and what size best fits your needs.  You can shorten the table legs and make a long coffee if you wanted. The options are endless. \n\nThe bling I used at the end of the video was a roll I bought at Hobby Lobby a couple of years ago. The roll was $14 and I used a half off coupon. I still have plenty left and I've been asked after showing this ribbon in the 5 piece vanity set DIY about a link. I haven't been able to find it at all on Hobby Lobby's website but I have seen this same roll online on wish.com & Amazon. If I find a link I'll share that as well and if you know of where to find it let us know in the comments & I'll share it here in the description box. You can use gems, Dollar Tree bling wrap, or even glitter. You do not have to do this exactly how I did if you choose to recreate this project.\n\nThank you so much for watching.

Hope you live just around the corner :)\n\nNow I'm going to cut the suspense short and reveal the names of my 4 easy sushi recipes as well as what to expect from the tips and tricks.\n\nSo I'm going to start with the most popular, the spicy tuna roll, then homemade salmon nigiri, followed by a delicious vegan sushi with asparagus and avocado.\n\nThen I'm going to finish with a super easy cucumber and salmon sushi roll recipe which is the popular sushi with rice on the outside.\n\nAnd before getting to the recipes, I must show you a few useful tips and tricks which will not only help you make the rolls easy but also crazy delish.\n\nHow to make sushi at home easy - Best Tips and Tricks\n\n1. Which is the best rice for sushi\nShort-grain Japanese or medium-grain California rice is the best rice for sushi because when cooked, it gets a stickier texture than the long-grain alternative. The latter usually gets fluffy after cooking which is great for many other dishes but not for homemade sushi.\n\nYou'll often find it labeled and advertised as sushi rice. The grains are short, rounded and translucent, with a small white spot at one end.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Japanese rice is often covered in powdered starch or talc to keep it dry. This is why it's very important to rinse it before cooking.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you should use a 1:1.25 rice to water ratio, which means that for every cup of rice you need to add 1 1/4 cup of water.\n\nNow let's move on and see how to season sushi rice.\n\n2. How to season sushi rice\nYou can season it with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt.\n\nYou'd have to mix these 3 ingredients well until the sugar and salt are perfectly dissolved. Then pour the mixture over the rice and, using a rice paddle, toss and stir gently being careful not to mash the grains.\n\nFor best flavor, you should add vinegar to the rice while it's still warm.\n\n3. How to fill and roll homemade sushi\n\nAs I said above, a sushi making kit is ideal for beginners because it makes the whole process a lot easier, especially rolling.\n\nI recommend you to wrap the bamboo mat in cling film to prevent the rice from getting between the bamboo sticks.\u00a0This way, you won't even have to wash it because it doesn't get in direct contact with any of the ingredients.\n\nOtherwise, you'll have to give it a quick wash under running water.\n\nYou're welcome! Now let's see a few more interesting tricks.\n\nBear in mind that the rolls must have a balanced rice-to-filling ratio. If you add too much filling, it won't roll and seal, and if you add too much rice, it'll come out way to bland.\n\nIf you're a beginner, it's best to stick to the quantities in my easy homemade sushi recipes below. Once you get the hang of it, you can start experimenting to see how you like it best.\n\nAnother trick worth mentioning is when you roll the bamboo mat, apply some pressure to make sure it's tight. If it's not tight enough, it will make cutting a lot more difficult as the filling will come off.\n\n\n\nFollow for more healthy and delicious recipes:\n\nWebsite: https://www.blondelish.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/blondelish\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theblondelish/\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blondelish/\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/theblondelish\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/u/0/117516317106293442770", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll7bFxr-kag/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll7bFxr-kag/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll7bFxr-kag/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll7bFxr-kag/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll7bFxr-kag/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Blondelish", "tags": ["homemade sushi", "homemade sushi rolls", "homemade sushi rice", "homemade sushi recipes", "homemade sushi for beginners", "how to make sushi", "how to make sushi rice", "how to make sushi at home", "how to make sushi rolls at home", "how to make sushi rolls", "how to make sushi easy", "how to make sushi easy step-by-step instructions", "Spicy tuna roll recipe", "Salmon nigiri sushi recipe", "Vegan Sushi recipe", "Salmon sushi roll recipe", "Easy Sushi Rice recipe", "sushi rolls"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "4 Easy Sushi Recipes - How To Make Sushi At Home Like A Pro - Blondelish", "description": "Full recipes: https://www.blondelish.com/recipes/easy-sushi-recipes-how-to-make-sushi-at-home/\n\nOrder Bamboo Sushi Kit:\nUSA: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W8PF858\nhttps://blauke.com/products/bamboo-sushi-making-kit-with-2-rolling-mats\n\nUK & EU: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W8PF858\n\nBuy my Cookbook I Heart Cheese on Amazon.com: https://amzn.to/3mVUfD9\nAmazon.co.uk: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Heart-Cheese-Cookbook-Delicious-Serious-ebook/dp/B082ZGDQKR\nBarnes & Noble: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/i-heart-cheese-mihaela-metaxa-albu/1135712299\nBook Depository (Free Worldwide Delivery): https://www.bookdepository.com/I-Heart-Cheese-Cookbook-Mihaela-Metaxa-Albu/9781645671800\nBooks-a-Million: https://www.booksamillion.com/p/Heart-Cheese/Mihaela-Metaxa-Albu/9781645671800\nIndiebound: https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781645671800\n\nHey Foodies,\n\nToday I'm going to show you how to make sushi at home like a pro and for that purpose I have 4 easy sushi recipes to show you.\n\nAnd I also included an easy sushi rice recipe because I know that this is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to making sushi at home.

This year my team wanted to film a special video to thank you all for watching our videos and all your amazing continued support!! One YouTube subscriber in particular has been very supportive for many years now, and we wanted to recognize him. His name is Matthew Dickson and he always leaves his mark by commenting, \"When hot wings video?\" As most of you know, I hate spicy food challenges, which is why I rarely do them. A LOT of people ask me to do some though, so for this Thanksgiving special, in honor of Matthew Dickson we wanted to film a hot wings video, and we used Wingstop since it hasn't yet been the focus of a fast food challenge video. I ordered one of Wingstop's 50pc \"Party Packs\" with 50 Atomic bone-in wings, 2 large sides (fries and Fried Cajun Corn), and some healthy carrots and celery sticks.

This year my team wanted to film a special video to thank you all for watching our videos and all your amazing continued support!! One YouTube subscriber in particular has been very supportive for many years now, and we wanted to recognize him. His name is Matthew Dickson and he always leaves his mark by commenting, \"When hot wings video?\" As most of you know, I hate spicy food challenges, which is why I rarely do them. A LOT of people ask me to do some though, so for this Thanksgiving special, in honor of Matthew Dickson we wanted to film a hot wings video, and we used Wingstop since it hasn't yet been the focus of a fast food challenge video. I ordered one of Wingstop's 50pc \"Party Packs\" with 50 Atomic bone-in wings, 2 large sides (fries and Fried Cajun Corn), and some healthy carrots and celery sticks. I tried to finish everything as fast as I could, and the wings were HOT!!

His parents, Owen and Ruth Brown. He was the fourth one born of their eight kids.\n\nNo, he didn\u2019t look like that when he was a baby. No one knows what he looked like when he was a baby, silly. \n\nBrown\u2019s family moved around a lot when he was a kid, but he spent most of his youth in Ohio. He had a very religious upbringing. Owen and Ruth also raised John to absolutely hate slavery. At 16 years old, he left his family and went to Plainfield, Massachusetts, where he studied to become a Congregationalist minister. Ultimately, though, Brown went into the same business as his dad. He raised cattle and worked as a tanner. You know, making leather from animal skins. At one point he was also a surveyor. You know, checking out the land and stuff.\n\nIn 1820, he married Dianthe Lusk. The couple eventually had 7 children together, and ended up settling in New Richmond, Pennsylvania. This is what\u2019s left of the tannery John Brown ran while living there. Between 1825 and 1835, the tannery was an important stop on the Underground Railroad. No it wasn\u2019t an actual railroad, you silly goose. The Underground Railroad was just what they called the secret network of routes and safe houses used to aid runaway slaves. It\u2019s estimated that Brown helped more than 2,500 slaves at that tannery.\n\nThe 1830s didn\u2019t begin so well for Brown. In 1831, his 4-year old son Frederick died. Brown himself got really sick and his businesses struggled, causing him to get in big debt. The next year, Dianthe died while giving birth to an unnamed son who also died shortly afterward. Clearly, this was a low point in Brown\u2019s life, but he soon met someone new...Mary Ann Day. She was 16. He was 32. They married on June 14, 1833. Eventually, they had 13 more kids together, although only six of them made it to adulthood.\n\nIn 1836, the Browns moved to what is now Kent, Ohio. The next year, after a pro-slavery mob murdered the influential abolitionist Elijah Parish Lovejoy, Brown stood up in the back of a church and said \u201cHere, before God, in the presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Ohio he had attempted again to operate a tannery, but struggled to make money from it. By 1839, he was again heavily in debt, and ended up losing his farm and getting arrested when he refused to give it up to its new owner. A federal court declared him bankrupt on September 28, 1842. The next year, four of his kids died of dysentery.\n\n#johnbrown #apush #americanhistory", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JaSMJ9l-bY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JaSMJ9l-bY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JaSMJ9l-bY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JaSMJ9l-bY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JaSMJ9l-bY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Mr. Beat", "tags": ["John Brown documentary", "John Brown Explained", "The Life and Times of John Brown", "Biography of John Brown", "john brown history channel video", "john brown abolitionist documentary", "john brown history channel", "john brown mr. beat", "john brown biography video", "john brown bleeding kansas", "john brown hero", "John Brown terrorist", "APUSH review", "john brown biography", "American history John Brown", "causes of the Civil War John Brown", "was John Brown a black man?", "John Brown good guy or bad guy"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Life and Times of John Brown", "description": "Was John Brown a hero or terrorist?

I also bring up the Nike Alphafly toward the end of the vlog as I'm sure it will make waves in the 2020 racing calendar. Do not fret, it looks like Saucony, Hoka, Adidas, and a couple other running shoe companies are beginning to explore the carbon fiber plate world.  Overall, stay positive when it comes to running shoes and technology, they are JUST shoes, and at the end of the day do not define anyone as a runner.

I also bring up the Nike Alphafly toward the end of the vlog as I'm sure it will make waves in the 2020 racing calendar. Do not fret, it looks like Saucony, Hoka, Adidas, and a couple other running shoe companies are beginning to explore the carbon fiber plate world.  Overall, stay positive when it comes to running shoes and technology, they are JUST shoes, and at the end of the day do not define anyone as a runner.

If you can finish the whole sundae in one sitting, you still pay $18 for the dessert but win a sweet t-shirt and a spot on their Wall of Fame. In this video, I attempted to eat two of their sundaes in one sitting, which was a littler touger than expected. Thanks for watching and thanks to everyone at Sweet Nellie's for the great experience!! The next Friday video will feature a big burger in Republic, MO.\n\nThis video was filmed on Saturday, May 4, 2019 (5/4/2019)\n\nCheck out our FoodChallenges.com YouTube Channel and How To Videos: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/foodchallengesvideos\n\nFOLLOW & SUPPORT ME AS I DOMINATE FOOD CHALLENGES ACROSS THE GLOBE WHILE\nALSO HELPING PEOPLE BETTER UNDERSTAND NUTRITION & WEIGHT MANAGEMENT:\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/RandySantel\nT-SHIRTS: http://www.FoodChallengeStore.com\nWEBSITE: http://www.RandySantel.com\nNEWSLETTER: https://www.foodchallenges.com/subscribe\nFACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/RandySantel\nTWITTER: http://www.twitter.com/RandySantel\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/RandySantel\n\nSweet Nellie's website: http://www.sweetnelliesicecream.com\n\nSweet Nellie's Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SweetNelliesIceCreamParlor\n\nFOOD CHALLENGE STRATEGIES & LOCATE AN EATING CHALLENGE NEAR YOU:\nhttp://www.foodchallenges.com\n\nWATCH VIDEOS FROM MY 2018 SUMMER TOUR:\nCzech Strongman Burger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwo-GbPmSos\nPablo EscoBar Burger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyf-x9fej1I\nJumbo Pork Schnitzel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtutWvGar-k\nBratislava Challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP64yKqtQRQ\nJohny's Austria Burger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgM_Vb1iOac\nStari Pisker Slovenia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suzRjcsGhys\nClaw BBQ Dubai Burger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK-TYpTWb60\n3ft Monster Dog Dubai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q6y_1cia-s\nMighty Quinn's BBQ Feast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaSpNkr1bjg\nEnglish Breakfast Thailand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef030ir7Auk\n4kg Thailand Curry Meal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgHKfxsmdfA\n\nFor Business Inquiries Only:\nAtlas [at] RandySantel.com\n\n** Randy Santel is a professional eater who specializes in winning and promoting restaurant food challenges all around the world.

The angle of inclination vary between 0 to 180 degrees.\n\nPolar orbit:\nA polar orbit is when the satellite rotates in a path that takes it over the North and South Poles in an orbital pattern that is perpendicular to the equatorial plane.Polar orbiting satellites follow a low altitude path close to earth\u2019s surface, passing over and very close to both the North and South Poles.\nThe angle of inclination of a satellite in a polar orbit is nearly 90 degrees.\n\nOn the basis of the altitude from Earth, the types of orbits are classified into: \n\n\u2022 Low Earth orbit (LEO):\nLow earth orbit satellites operate at a distance of about 160 to 2,000 kilometres above the earth's surface.\nIt takes approximately 90 to120 minutes to circle the Earth.\n\u2022 Medium earth orbit (MEO):\nMedium earth orbit is the\u00a0region of\u00a0space around the Earth above\u00a0low Earth\u00a0orbit and below\u00a0geostationary\u00a0orbit.\nThe orbital periods of\u00a0Medium earth orbit satellites\u00a0range from about two to six hours.\nThis satellite operates at altitudes between 2,000 kilometers and 35,786 kilometers above the earth\u2019s surface.\n\u2022 Geostationary earth orbit\u00a0(GEO):\nA\u00a0geostationary satellite\u00a0is an earth-orbiting\u00a0satellite. it placed at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers directly over the equator, that revolves in the same direction the earth rotates that means west to east.\nThis satellite takes 24 hours to orbit the Earth. \n\nOrbits are also classified into two types on the basis of the shape:  \n\u2022 Circular orbit\n\u2022 Elliptical orbit\n\nCircular orbit:\nCircular orbit\u00a0is the\u00a0orbit\u00a0with a fixed distance around the\u00a0barycenter, that is, in the shape of a\u00a0circle.

However, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home. It\u2019s unclear if the firearm was found near the woman, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she had a gun.

What a great weekend of mountain racing by all competitors, from the elites like Kilian Jornet, Sage Canaday, and Maude Mathys, to those who are just making their mark in the sport of mountain running. The Pikes Peak Marathon course record FELL today, but not on the men\u2019s side, rather on the women\u2019s side of the Pikes Peak race, by the Swiss runner, Maude Mathys, who absolutely shattered the old course record by over 12 minutes! What an incredible effort in the Pikes Peak Marathon by Maude Mathys, I was very impressed with her climbing capabilities. And on the men\u2019s side of the Pikes Peak Marathon mountain race, I was very excited to finally see Kilian Jornet run in person, who is from Spain and the Salomon Running crew over in France. Kilian Jornet topped out on top in 2:09.15 and finished off the day just under 3 hours and 30 minutes, about 14 minutes back from Matt Carpenter\u2019s Pikes Peak Marathon course record from 1993. Matt Carpenter\u2019s course record will fall\u2026.someday\u2026.? All records are meant to be broken, but this Pikes Peak Ascent and Marathon course record may have a few more years or even decades left in it.

What a great weekend of mountain racing by all competitors, from the elites like Kilian Jornet, Sage Canaday, and Maude Mathys, to those who are just making their mark in the sport of mountain running. The Pikes Peak Marathon course record FELL today, but not on the men\u2019s side, rather on the women\u2019s side of the Pikes Peak race, by the Swiss runner, Maude Mathys, who absolutely shattered the old course record by over 12 minutes! What an incredible effort in the Pikes Peak Marathon by Maude Mathys, I was very impressed with her climbing capabilities. And on the men\u2019s side of the Pikes Peak Marathon mountain race, I was very excited to finally see Kilian Jornet run in person, who is from Spain and the Salomon Running crew over in France. Kilian Jornet topped out on top in 2:09.15 and finished off the day just under 3 hours and 30 minutes, about 14 minutes back from Matt Carpenter\u2019s Pikes Peak Marathon course record from 1993. Matt Carpenter\u2019s course record will fall\u2026.someday\u2026.? All records are meant to be broken, but this Pikes Peak Ascent and Marathon course record may have a few more years or even decades left in it. Overall the Pikes Peak Marathon race results from 2019 were very impressive from Kilian Jornet and Maude Mathys, all the way down to the final finisher.

It came a day after the jury convicted her of murder in the September 2018 killing of Botham Jean.\n\nGuyger\u2019s sentence was met with boos and jeers by a crowd gathered outside the courtroom. \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face,\u201d one woman said.\n\nAs Jean\u2019s family walked out of the courtroom, the group that had been outside began a chant of, \u201cNo justice! No peace!\u201d Two young black women hugged each other and cried.\n\nProsecutors had asked jurors to sentence Guyger to at least 28 years, which is how old Jean would have been if he was still alive.\n\nThe jury could have sentenced the former officer to up to life in prison or as little as two years.\n\nThe basic facts of the unusual shooting were not in dispute throughout the trial. Guyger, returning from a long shift that night, entered Jean\u2019s fourth-floor apartment and shot him. He had been eating a bowl of ice cream before she fired.\n\nGuyger said she parked on the wrong floor and mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own, which was directly below his, and mistook him for a burglar. In the frantic 911 call played repeatedly during the trial, Guyger said \u201cI thought it was my apartment\u201d nearly 20 times. Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants going to the wrong apartments.\n\nBut prosecutors questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place. They also asked why she didn\u2019t call for backup instead of walking into the apartment if she thought she was being burglarized and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages she had been exchanging with her police partner, who was also her lover.\n\nThe shooting drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nTICTOC ON SOCIAL:\nFollow TicToc on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tictoc\nLike TicToc on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tictoc\nFollow TicToc on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tictoc\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\n\nTicToc by Bloomberg is global news for the life you lead.

When the prosecutors walked into the hall, they broke into cheers.\n\nGuyger sat alone, weeping, at the defense table.\n\nIn Texas, the sentence for murder is from five to 99 years in prison. The jury is expected to return Tuesday afternoon for the punishment phase of the trial.\n\nThe basic facts of the unusual shooting were not in dispute throughout the trial. In September 2018, Guyger walked up to Jean\u2019s apartment \u2014 which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third \u2014 and found the door unlocked. She was off duty but still dressed in her police uniform after a long shift when she shot Jean with her service weapon. The 26-year-old accountant had been eating a bowl of ice cream before Guyger entered his home.\n\n\nJean, who grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, came to the U.S. for college before starting his career as an accountant. His shooting drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\n\u201cA 26-year-old college-educated black man, certified public accountant, working for one of the big three accounting firms in the world ... it shouldn\u2019t take all of that for unarmed black and brown people in America to get justice,\u201d Benjamin Crump, one of the lawyer\u2019s for Jean\u2019s family, said at a news conference.\n\nCrump said the verdict honors other people of color who were killed by police officers who were not convicted of a crime.\n\nAttorney Lee Merritt, who also represents the family, underlined Crump\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory, not only for the family of Botham Jean, but this is a victory for black people in America. It\u2019s a signal that the tide is going to change here. Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions, and we believe that will begin to change policing culture around the world,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nThe jury that convicted Guyger was largely made up of women and people of color.\n\nGuyger was arrested three days after the killing. She was later fired and charged with murder , but only spoke publicly about the shooting upon taking the witness stand last Friday. Tension has been high during the trial in Dallas, the same city where an attack three years ago killed five police officers.\n\nThe 31-year-old tearfully apologized for killing Jean and told the jurors she feared for her life upon finding the door to what she thought was her apartment unlocked. Guyger said that Jean came toward her at a fast walk when she entered with her gun out, but prosecutors have suggested he was just rising from a couch toward the back of the room when the officer shot him.\n\nIn a frantic 911 call played repeatedly during the trial, Guyger said \u201cI thought it was my apartment\u201d nearly 20 times. Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants to the wrong apartments.\n\nProsecutors, however, questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place, and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages with her police partner.\n\nThey also asked why Guyger didn\u2019t radio in for help when she thought there was a break-in at her home. Guyger said that going through the doorway with her pistol drawn, \u201cwas the only option that went through my head.\u201d\n\nTICTOC ON SOCIAL:\nFollow TicToc on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tictoc\nLike TicToc on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tictoc\nFollow TicToc on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tictoc\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\n\nTicToc by Bloomberg is global news for the life you lead.

The idea here is giving team members an upside if the collaborate to increase the company valuation. \n\nOn public companies,  that is, companies whose stock has been listed on a public stock exchange, this works somewhat differently, so I won't get into that. I've never worked for one of those. This video is mostly about private companies: startups where the stock is owned by the founders and their select investors. \n\nIt all starts with a stock option pool. This is a pool of shares that the company issues, and that it 'reserves' for employees. On paper, this is a legal document signed and approved by the Board of Directors, and it represents a new issue of company shares. \n\nWe made a video about how stock works, and how shares can be issued to investors, so go check it out if any of this seems confusing. \n\nThe example we'll use today is our own company, Slidebean. \n\nIn 2016, in combination with our investor round (which is usually when Stock Option Pools are created), we decided to create a stock option pool of around 5% of the company. In this case, the company issued 530,000 new shares of stock, additional to the 10,000,000 shares we had when the company was founded. \n\nThis means the company now had a total of 10,530,000 shares issued. Those 530,000 represent 5.03% of the total shares the company has issued. \n\nEven though our team already had around 10 people then, we wanted to compensate the early employees, those who had joined us when we were in the earliest stage. We also needed some stock options for new, key employees we were about to recruit. \n\nNow, at this time, our latest company valuation was about $2.5MM. Which means each share has a value of roughly $0.2374 dollars.\n\nSo, say we want to give 100,000 shares (around 1% of the company) to Dwight. If we just gave him these shares, Dwight would have received assets valued at around $25,000, which would be taxable. He would have to pay taxes for these assets, that he can't necessarily cash out. \n\nSo, instead of giving them these shares, the company gives them stock options. That is, the option to purchase those shares at a defined value. \n\nThat value is usually connected directly to the valuation of the company at the time, so in this case, the price per share, or STRIKE PRICE is $0.2374. \nNow what's really happening is the company is giving Dwight the right to buy 100,000 company shares at a defined price of $23,740. \n\nNow here's where the fun happens. Say a few years the company gets acquired and the startup is no longer valued at $2,500,000 but at $25,000,000. \n\nAt the time of the acquisition, Dwight exercises his stock options. He has this unique right to pay $0.2374 per share. The buyer, however, has agreed to pay $2.347 per share. The difference, roughly $2.11 per share, is Dwight's margin. \nSo just to clarify, Dwight will never have to pay those $23,740 out of his pocket, he'll simply collect the earnings as part of the acquisition paperwork. \n\nNow, I've oversimplified this to make it easier to understand. In all likelihood, the company will have issued new shares during that time. That's why it's important to understand that the stock option pool is represented in shares, not in percentages. \nThe 100,000 shares Dwight received represented around 1% of the company back then, but later on, they might represent much less. It's the difference between the strike price and the price per share that gives Dwight his edge. \n\nThis is important to understand, because if the company doesn't increase in value, then those stock options are not really worth much. The employee can still buy them\n------------\n\n\u25ba Subscribe to our Channel Here \nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=slidebean\n\n-- About Us: \nSlidebean is a pitch deck creation tool with hundreds of templates available to use as a starting point.

The trail running shoe collection continues to grow, which I'm excited to share with all of you today on the daily running vlog. Trail running shoes are very diverse because of the incredible range of trails that exist in this world.

The VDRL test is used to screen for syphilis (it has high sensitivity), whereas other, more specific tests are used to diagnose the disease.\nVDRL test: A #blood test for syphilis (VDRL stands for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) that detects an antibody that is present in the bloodstream when a patient has syphilis.\n\nA negative (nonreactive) VDRL is compatible with a person not having syphilis, but in the early stages of the disease, the VDRL often gives false negative results. Conversely, a false positive VDRL can be encountered in infectious mononucleosis, lupus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hepatitis A, leprosy, malaria and, occasionally, pregnancy.\nWhat is syphilis?\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by an infection with bacteria known as Treponema pallidum. Like other STDs, syphilis can be spread by any type of sexual contact. Syphilis can also be spread from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy or to the baby at the time of birth.\n\nSyphilis has been described for centuries. It can cause long-term damage to different organs if not properly treated.\n\nWhat causes syphillis?\nThe bacteria that cause syphilis, Treponema pallidum, are referred to as spirochetes due to their spiral shape. The organisms penetrate into the lining of the mouth or genital area.\nThere are two types of tests used to diagnose syphilis: treponemal tests (that identify antibodies to the causative organism) and non-treponemal tests (that identify the body's response to the infection but not to the organism itself).\n\nThe blood tests used to screen for syphilis are called the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests detect the body's response to the infection, but not to the actual Treponema organism. While these are good screening tests, they are not specific enough to establish the diagnosis.

The VDRL test is used to screen for syphilis (it has high sensitivity), whereas other, more specific tests are used to diagnose the disease.\nVDRL test: A #blood test for syphilis (VDRL stands for Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) that detects an antibody that is present in the bloodstream when a patient has syphilis.\n\nA negative (nonreactive) VDRL is compatible with a person not having syphilis, but in the early stages of the disease, the VDRL often gives false negative results. Conversely, a false positive VDRL can be encountered in infectious mononucleosis, lupus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hepatitis A, leprosy, malaria and, occasionally, pregnancy.\nWhat is syphilis?\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by an infection with bacteria known as Treponema pallidum. Like other STDs, syphilis can be spread by any type of sexual contact. Syphilis can also be spread from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy or to the baby at the time of birth.\n\nSyphilis has been described for centuries. It can cause long-term damage to different organs if not properly treated.\n\nWhat causes syphillis?\nThe bacteria that cause syphilis, Treponema pallidum, are referred to as spirochetes due to their spiral shape. The organisms penetrate into the lining of the mouth or genital area.\nThere are two types of tests used to diagnose syphilis: treponemal tests (that identify antibodies to the causative organism) and non-treponemal tests (that identify the body's response to the infection but not to the organism itself).\n\nThe blood tests used to screen for syphilis are called the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests. These tests detect the body's response to the infection, but not to the actual Treponema organism. While these are good screening tests, they are not specific enough to establish the diagnosis. These tests can give false-positive results, so a positive screening VDRL or RPR test must be followed by a treponemal test to detect the organism.\n\nA number of different tests are available that detect antibodies to Treponema pallidum bacteria. Examples include the microhemagglutination assay for T. pallidum (MHA-TP) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS).

You need to know the difference among tidal volume (TV), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), residual volume (RV), minimal air, inspiratory capacity (IC), functional residual capacity (FRC), vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC). \n\nSpirometry can measure most of them except the residual volume and any capacity that's related to the residual volume (i.e. functional residual capacity, and total lung capacity).\n\nIn the next video, we'll discuss the FEV1/FVC ratio and how to use to differentiate between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases.\n\n\u25ba Clinically-oriented anatomy of the thorax (part 1): https://youtu.be/SRLIpt4ObMg  ...\n\u25ba Virchow's node: https://youtu.be/dOE1WI_9874\n\u25ba Respiratory pharmacology https://youtu.be/qM86wPKuPk4\n\u25ba Pulmonology playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYcLrRDaR8_dU-SqmEQlxINRVMmVsqYYO\n\u25ba If you like these videos, please consider leaving a tip at www.paypal.me/perfectionalis/  \n\n\n\u25ba If you like my videos, please consider leaving a tip at https://www.paypal.me/perfectionalis/\n\n\n*** As a small gift for my viewers, here are 2 FREE audiobooks from Audible https://amzn.to/2FQurW0 Learning has never been easier..\n\n*** Also, try Amazon Kindle unlimited for FREE, they have some good medical books that you can read for FREE. https://amzn.to/2UceoG2\n\n\ud83e\udd70 Picture-Mnemonics https://www.picmonic.com/referrals/JK55NQXQQB9JLC119 ...You can thank me later \ud83d\ude09.\n\n\ud83d\udcd7 Get my notes in pdf files that are downloadable at https://www.patreon.com/medicosis/ If you like my videos, please consider leaving a tip at https://www.paypal.me/perfectionalis/ \n\u25ba Visit my website: https://www.medicosisperfectionalis.com/ My Favorite Productivity App: https://airtable.com/invite/r/2zH40fus/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT32M15S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "39126", "likeCount": "960", "dislikeCount": "29", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "127"}, "recordingDetails": {"locationDescription": "United States", "location": {"latitude": 37.09024, "longitude": -95.712891, "altitude": 0}, "recordingDate": "2019-08-26T00:00:00Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "YdfrJXc5rqRKXiukbxTva5nBXmE", "id": "0ojrgyrhXd8", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-08-15T14:17:27Z", "channelId": "UCpReOfsFjnDpA5LBbONLQWA", "title": "TelComm | Free Checking (No Strings Attached)", "description": "TelComm Credit Union offers FREE checking, no strings attached.

Ross Perot, the colorful, self-made Texas billionaire who rose from a childhood of Depression-era poverty and twice ran for president as a third-party candidate, has died. He was 89.\n\nPerot, whose 19% of the vote in 1992 stands among the best showings by an independent candidate in the past century, died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his devoted family, family spokesman James Fuller said.\n\nAs a boy in Texarkana, Texas, Perot delivered newspapers from the back of a pony. He earned his billions in a more modern way, however \u2014 by building Electronic Data Systems Corp., which helped other companies manage their computer networks.\n\nYet the most famous event in his career didn\u2019t involve sales and earnings; he financed a private commando raid in 1979 to free two EDS employees who were being held in a prison in Iran. The tale was turned into a book and a movie.\n\nPerot first became known to Americans outside of business circles by claiming that the U.S. government left behind hundreds of American soldiers who were missing or imprisoned at the end of the Vietnam War. Perot fanned the issue at home and discussed it privately with Vietnamese officials in the 1980s, angering the Reagan administration, which was formally negotiating with Vietnam\u2019s government.\n\nPerot\u2019s wealth, fame and confident prescription for the nation\u2019s economic ills propelled his 1992 campaign against President George H.W. Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. Some Republicans blamed him for Bush\u2019s lost to Clinton as Perot garnered the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s 1912 bid.\n\nDuring the campaign, Perot spent $63.5 million of his own money and bought up 30-minute television spots. He used charts and graphs to make his points, summarizing them with a line that became a national catchphrase: \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nPerot\u2019s second campaign four years later was far less successful. He was shut out of presidential debates when organizers said he lacked sufficient support. He got just 8% of the vote, and the Reform Party that he founded and hoped to build into a national political force began to fall apart.\n\nHowever, Perot\u2019s ideas on trade and deficit reduction remained part of the political landscape. He blamed both major parties for running up a huge federal budget deficit and letting American jobs to be sent to other countries. The movement of U.S. jobs to Mexico, he said, created a \u201cgiant sucking sound.\u201d\n\nPerot continued to speak out about federal spending for many years. In 2008, he launched a website to highlight the nation\u2019s debt with a ticker that tracked the rising total, a blog and a chart presentation.\n\nHenry Ross Perot was born in Texarkana on June 27, 1930. His father was a cotton broker; his mother a secretary. Perot said his family survived the Depression relatively well through hard work and by managing their money carefully.\n\nYoung Perot\u2019s first job was delivering papers in a poor, mostly black part of town from his pony, Miss Bee. Perot said when the newspaper tried to cut his commission, he complained to the publisher \u2014 and won. He said he learned to take problems straight to the top.\n\nFrom Texarkana, Perot went to the U.S. Naval Academy even though he had never been on a ship or seen the ocean. After the Navy, Perot joined International Business Machines in 1955 and quickly became a top salesman. In his last year at IBM, he filled his sales quota for the year in January.\n\nIn 1962, with $1,000 from his wife, Margot, Perot founded Electronic Data Systems. Hardware accounted for about 80% of the computer business, Perot said, and IBM wasn\u2019t interested in the other 20%, including services.\n\nMany of the early hires at EDS were former military men, and they had to abide by Perot\u2019s strict dress code \u2014 white shirts, ties, no beards or mustaches \u2014 and long work days. Many had crew cuts, like Perot.\n\nThe company\u2019s big break came in the mid-1960s when the federal government created Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for seniors, the disabled and the poor. States needed help in running the programs, and EDS won contracts \u2014 starting in Texas \u2014 to handle the millions of claims.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nTICTOC ON SOCIAL:\nFollow TicToc on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tictoc\nLike TicToc on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tictoc\nFollow TicToc on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tictoc\n\nWatch all of TicToc\u2019s videos: https://www.tictoc.video/\n\nListen to TicToc\u2019s podcast: https://apple.co/2D3Vta7\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\n\nTicToc by Bloomberg is global news for the life you lead.

In C++, templates are the primary tool for generic programming, and they're used throughout the standard library. Templates can be functions or classes, as well as variables or type aliases.\n\nThis session is for C++ programmers who would like to shore up their understanding of templates. It describes many C++ template features and offers insights into how compilers use compile-time information, such as types and values, to process templates.\n\nThis session begins by showing how to define function templates and how call them using explicitly-specified or deduced template arguments. It then covers class templates, including the behavior of static data members, friends, and nested classes appearing in class templates. It explains why template definitions require explicit qualification or the keyword typename in some situations. It presents the different forms of template parameters and corresponding arguments, as well as default arguments. Throughout, it clears up common misunderstandings regarding templates, such as the differences among the mechanisms of instantiation and the different flavors of specialization.\n\u2014 \nDan Saks\nSaks & Associates\nPresident\n\nDan Saks is the president of Saks & Associates, which offers training and consulting in C and C++ and their use in developing embedded systems.

In C++, templates are the primary tool for generic programming, and they're used throughout the standard library. Templates can be functions or classes, as well as variables or type aliases.\n\nThis session is for C++ programmers who would like to shore up their understanding of templates. It describes many C++ template features and offers insights into how compilers use compile-time information, such as types and values, to process templates.\n\nThis session begins by showing how to define function templates and how call them using explicitly-specified or deduced template arguments. It then covers class templates, including the behavior of static data members, friends, and nested classes appearing in class templates. It explains why template definitions require explicit qualification or the keyword typename in some situations. It presents the different forms of template parameters and corresponding arguments, as well as default arguments. Throughout, it clears up common misunderstandings regarding templates, such as the differences among the mechanisms of instantiation and the different flavors of specialization.\n\u2014 \nDan Saks\nSaks & Associates\nPresident\n\nDan Saks is the president of Saks & Associates, which offers training and consulting in C and C++ and their use in developing embedded systems.

World!\nhttps://imbestreviews.shortcm.li/F1PqQz\n\nIndependence Day In America \u2013 The Fourth Of July (1776)!\n\nAmericans in the USA enjoy hanging flags from their rooftops, their cars or letting them flap in the wind.  Wearing red, white and blue is the traditional 4th of July attire.  Many different cities have varied activities.  Some may sport parades, some backyard barbecues with family and friends and of course, fireworks are the official ending to a wonderful 4th of July celebration all across the country in many cities and towns.\n\nIndependence Day In Canada!\n\nSimilar to the US Independence Day Celebration, Canadians also celebrate with parades, concerts, ceremonies and of course fireworks.  But their Independence Day represents The British North America Act which established the federal government of Canada on July 1, 1867.  This act united the British colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec.  \n\nFrance \u2013 The Bastille \u2013 July 14\n\nThe Storming of Bastille, a prison in Paris happened on July 14, 1789 \u2013 the beginning of the French Revolution.  It is considered \u201cFrench National Day,\u201d or \u201cla fete nationale.\"  In Paris, this day kicks off with a military parade on the Champs Elysees. For the French, it is a day of no work and all play.\n\nA Fireman\u2019s Gala takes place on Bastille Day.   All throughout the country, fire stations open their doors to the public for a jolly good time of dancing and drinking! \n\nThere are festivals, and fireworks all day long often occurring during the Tour de France (bicycle racing).  This gala event ends with fireworks over the Eiffel Tower.\n\nNorway - May 17, 1814 - \"Syttende Mai\"\n\nOn Constitution Day, Norwegians wake up to the sound of marching bands, the sights of parades and traditional \"bunad\" costumes, and the creamy sweetness of ice cream.  \n\nAnother tradition is the \"17th of May breakfast.\" Often a big happy potluck with friends and neighbors, this kick-off meal consists of favorites like fresh bread, eggs, smoked salmon - and lots of champagne, of course. \n\nChildren play a special part in the celebration of their Independence Day.  Several children\u2019s parades are held during the day, where the children march with flags and school banners led by marching bands. In the capital city of Oslo, the children will pass the Royal Palace, where the royal family will wave to the parade participants from the balcony. In the evening, people gather with family and friends to have dinner or barbeques together.\n\nAustralia Day commemorates the establishment of the first British settlement in Australia on January 26, 1788.  \n\nThere are barbecues, some fireworks and the beach (if you\u2019re near one).  In Sydney, popular events include a ferry race, a surfing race, and a tall ships race. \n\nFireworks are even launched from skyscrapers, moving boats, and bridges.\n\nBulgaria Independence Day History \u2013 September 22\n\nBulgaria's Independence Day celebrates the nation's independence from the Ottoman Empire.  Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria officially declared independence on 22 September 1908,\n\nThere are masses held in the cathedrals as well as street parades.  Musicians perform throughout the celebrations. The parades include military, civilian and even a bicycle parade. \n.\nThe city of Veliko Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire is the site on which the nation's independence was declared.  Bulgarians will enjoy some of their favorite foods\nBulgaria is known for its gorgeous building architecture, the black sea, lakes, beaches, and the beautiful countryside and of course waterfalls.\n\nIndia - Aug. 15 represents the end of British colonial rule in 1947. \n\nThe prime minister's speech in New Delhi from the Red Fort represents the peak of festivities.  \n\nIndia celebrates with flag-waving, parades, and patriotic songs.  But India also has a unique twist \u2013 on this day the skies are plastered with colorful kites of every size and color.  To symbolize its freedom from British rule, saffron, white and emerald-green kites copying the young country\u2019s tri-colored flag are flown.   They also end their day of celebration with fireworks.\n\nMexico September 15-16\n\nThe celebration begins at 11 p.m. on Sept. 15 when the president rings the historic liberty bell. Then he gives the \"El Grito,\" shouting \"Mexicanos, Viva Mexico.\" \n\nThere are rodeos, bullfights, parades, traditional Mexican dances and of course fireworks!  \n\nMusic for your videos:\nhttps://soundsup.io\n\nOur YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/ImBestReviewsA1\n\nSome Of Our Videos:\nhttps://youtu.be/pp6yEmBUlY8\nhttps://youtu.be/FYQCSBbuKcU\nhttps://youtu.be/Vb_l4OVLQwo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGhT8VjNPPA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A4qzYUFeJOs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A4qzYUFeJOs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A4qzYUFeJOs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A4qzYUFeJOs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A4qzYUFeJOs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "IM Best Reviews", "tags": ["4th of July", "Independence day", "independence day parades", "Canadian Independence Day", "British North America Act", "France Bastille Day", "French Revollution", "French National Day", "Tour de France", "Norwegian Constitution Day", "Australian Independence Day", "Bulgarian Independence Day", "India Independence Day", "saffron white emerald green flag and kites", "Viva Mexico", "Indpendence days around the World", "special days worldwide", "july 4th", "4th of july fireworks", "IMBR", "IM Best Reviews"], "categoryId": "19", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "US Fourth Of July Celebration - And Special Days Worldwide!", "description": "US Fourth Of July Celebration - And Special Days Around The World!\nhttps://imbestreviews.shortcm.li/F1PqQz\n\nIndependence Day In America \u2013 The Fourth Of July (1776)!\n\nAmericans in the USA enjoy hanging flags from their rooftops, their cars or letting them flap in the wind.

terms lvalue, rvalue, and xvalue, if only because they occasionally appear in compiler error messages. However, if you have only a vague understanding of what they mean, you're not alone. Lvalues, rvalues, and xvalues aren't actually language features, but rather semantic properties of expressions and sub-expressions. Understanding these properties provides valuable insights into the behavior of built-in operators, the code generated to execute those operators, and the meaning of some otherwise cryptic compiler error messages. Understanding these properties is also essential for working effectively with lvalue and rvalue reference types, as well as overloaded operators. \n\nThis session explains why the language distinguishes among lvalues, rvalues, and xvalues.

Lvalues, rvalues, and xvalues aren't actually language features, but rather semantic properties of expressions and sub-expressions. Understanding these properties provides valuable insights into the behavior of built-in operators, the code generated to execute those operators, and the meaning of some otherwise cryptic compiler error messages. Understanding these properties is also essential for working effectively with lvalue and rvalue reference types, as well as overloaded operators. \n\nThis session explains why the language distinguishes among lvalues, rvalues, and xvalues. It describes how the semantic properties of lvalues, rvalues, and xvalues are different and how those properties are reflected in the behavior of lvalue and rvalue references.\n\u2014 \nBen Saks\nChief Engineer, Saks & Associates\n\u2014\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT53M48S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "10929", "likeCount": "283", "dislikeCount": "5", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "12"}, "recordingDetails": {"locationDescription": "Aurora", "location": {"latitude": 39.7294319, "longitude": -104.8319195, "altitude": 0}, "recordingDate": "2019-09-19T00:00:00Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "53OuDOdPEJlwXfFgOLWex6XKZac", "id": "EG0tg9OEsUE", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-09-02T11:00:06Z", "channelId": "UCTLqLttIfwAKazQgEt7AC2w", "title": "ERY9O - HENNESSY", "description": "Follow ERY9O :\n Instagram :@ery9o\n\nFollow Dessescary :\n Instagram : @Dessescary\n\nFor Business Please Contact :\nBusiness.dessescary@gmail.com\n\nRecorded, Mixed by ERIGO.

Yes, software that will get you as much free traffic as you could ever want with just a few clicks of your mouse.  Do you think you would be able to make more sales online if you could get as much free traffic as you wanted?\n\nHow are things going with your online or offline business?  Maybe you are a Newbie \u2013 not knowing where to start or maybe you have been trying to make it online for a while now.  Are you making the money you want to?  Or are you struggling like many others?  \n\nThe reason most people fail online is that they just don\u2019t have enough high-quality traffic!  Without traffic, you don\u2019t have a business.  Most paid traffic methods are very expensive or don\u2019t convert into sales.  And most FREE traffic methods take forever to start working and take countless hours to get set up correctly.\n\nThe creators of Traffic Xtractor Ultimate (Art Flair, Declan Mc, and Alex Krulik) know what it is like to struggle to get the traffic that you need to build your business \u2013 make sales!  They got together and brainstormed on how to get quality traffic for FREE with some new traffic methods.  This software works great for \u201caffiliate marketers\u201d looking for more high converting traffic, product owners, eCom site owners, service providers, and even offline business owners.  \n\nActually, Alex had been getting quality traffic with a simple method by using simple little videos.  These are basic videos that anyone can make in a few minutes.  His method consisted of finding long-tail keywords (\u201cWinning Keywords)) with no more than one competing video in the search results and between 50 and 5,000 searches per month.  After uploading these little videos he got high converting traffic that pointed to related affiliate offers and made sales very quickly.  \n\nIn a NUTSHELL \u2013 To get high-quality traffic for free, you just:\n\n1.   Find several long-tail keywords with no more than one competitive video online in the search results and between 500 and 5,000 searches per month.\n2. Create simple and short videos.\n3. Upload the videos, get traffic, make sales.\n\nAnd with this software, you will learn to find profitable keywords with little or no competition that you can rank for and get quality traffic.  You will save hours of your precious time by using software instead of doing this manually.  Find multiple keywords with one click of your mouse.  \n\nYou will get over-the-shoulder video training.  Plus a real-life case study that is included where the creators show you exactly how they were able to rank their videos on page one of both Google and YouTube in a matter of minutes.  \n\nMaybe you are worried about making videos you say \u2013 don\u2019t be \u2013 they will teach you a very simple way to make videos that convert into sales.  No need to show your face on the videos if you are shy.  \n\nPlus Other Special Features Which Include:\n\nSuggestions for: Video title, description curating and optimization of your videos.\n\nAnd Google suggested keywords, Google related keywords, Bing suggested keywords and Bing related keywords.\nYou also get bonuses:  including additional training \u2013 cheat sheets, a marketing guide, a special report and a Facebook Mastermind Group where you can ask the creators questions along with \u201cTube Traffic Avalanche!\u201d\n\nWhat are you waiting for \u2013 at least take a look at the sales page \u2013 the link is beneath the video in the description box.

The idea grows on you, though, sometimes to the point that you can\u2019t imagine writing programs any other way. \n\nNow, if you aren\u2019t practicing TDD already, one class may not make you into a fresh convert; for attendees in that category, my goal is to convince you that it\u2019s not completely stupid and that \u201cthere is something there.\u201d \n\nIn C++, TDD offers significant advantages but also poses some language-specific challenges you should be aware of. The difficulties are severe enough that TDD in C++ is often limited to small isolated components or low-level libraries. It gets harder when we want to build a large system, but it\u2019s not impossible. \n\nWe will learn about specific programming techniques such as dependency injection. Perhaps more importantly, we will see how the decision to use TDD influences the design process and the resulting software architecture. Some of the problems we will encounter when trying to follow TDD practices in C++ have at most tolerable solutions if we limit ourselves to language tricks. We can make our software-testing life much easier if we build testability into the software from the design stage, which, in turn, makes the software itself better. \n\u2014 \n\nFedor Pikus\nMentor Graphics\nChief Scientist\nPortland, Oregon Area\n\nFedor G Pikus is a Chief Engineering Scientist in the Design to Silicon division of Mentor \nGraphics Corp (Siemens business).

Zhukov & Rokossovsky", "description": "WW2 in Color 12/13 Part 2\n\nHistorical documents:\nhttp://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org\n\nGeneral Zhukov wrote in his memoir about WW2.\nZhukov's memoir is put on\u00a0\nhttps://archive.org\n\nIn 1930s, Japanese military threatened Europe. \nIf Japan integrated China & East Asia at the time, large military nation world appear.\nPeople of the world estimated that this military nation world be consist of 500 million people.\nSo Germany had to reinforce military in order to defend nationals from Japan.\nJapan gave Germany large anxiety.  \nThus, Japan urged appearance of militarism by fascist in Germany.\nFascist would not take power if Japan did not invade Asian countries.\nTherefore, a cause of serious militarization in Germany is Japanese invasion.\nWW2 did not occur if Japan did not aggrandize territory.\n\nTo teens:\nOf course, Germany will never invade in the future.\nThe reason is as follows:\n1. Evil German genes were eradicated in the war, and good German genes remained.\n2. Fascists were minority among Germans even at that time. German Prime Minister Schmidt said in his memoir that if he refused to go to the battlefront in wartime, he and his family would be killed by police. \nMany German soldiers were forced to fight on the battlefront.\n3. European Union was created. Germany contribute greatly to the world as leader now.\n\n- History -\nIn 1930s, Hitler tried to integrate Europe. Hitler invaded Austria, and annexed in 1938. Afterwards, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, and annexed Czeco, and prepared to invade Poland in 1939.\n\nIn such situation, Soviet Union - Russia national leader Joseph Stalin decided to conclude the non aggression pact with Germany in order to avoid war in 1939. Stalin understood that many victims would appear if war with Germany occurs. In fact, Russia lost more than 20 millions people in WW II. For such a reason, Stalin, as the national leader, had to conclude the non aggression pact with Germany in order to protect peoples. \n\nKremlin submitted the draft of the non aggression pact to Hitler through Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov at the same time to conclude trade agreement with Germany. In this trade agreement, it was decided that Russia would offer raw materials to Germany and Germany would offer coal and industrial products to Russia. Russia observed the agreement article in detail. \n\nAfterwards, on August 21, 1939, Stalin received the letter about the non aggression pact from Hitler. The content is as follows:\n/--\nI welcome the conclusion of the trade agreement heartily. This treaty means the first step to lead to the change of our  relationships.\nThe non aggression pact conclusion means realization of German long term policy of future. That is why, our country gets back to the policy that bring two countries profit. \nI receive the draft of the non aggression pact submitted by Mr. Molotov. However, I think that we have to clarify the problems about this treaty as soon as possible.\nI am convinced that the two countries can clarify contents of the attachment Protocol extremely in short term as your country government demanded if our country official talks about the problem in Moscow. It is difficult to be clarified the attached protocol during short term if the Moscow arrival interval of our country official is not realized.\nThe strain between Germany and Poland becomes serious. The act of Poland to become the large country will produce crisis immediately. Germany will make up its mind to have possibilities to use every means in future to protect national interest from such the aggression.\nI am convinced that if we establish mutual new relations between the two countries, it is not wise to waste time. So I suggest that you receive our Minister of Foreign Affairs Tuesday 22, or, at most, Wednesday 23.\nIn view of the international situation, the stay of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Moscow of more than 1 or 2 days is impossible. I am thankful if you can have prompt answer.\n--/\n\nGerman Minister of Foreign Affairs Ribbentrop arrived at Moscow on August 22, 1939 and went to Kremlin. He immediately concluded the non aggression pact without wasting time for negotiations. He consented to all the main demands of Russia and signed the non aggression pact document in the ceremony Stalin attended. \nStalin was not affirmative that Germany would attack Poland, but, he had to conclude the non aggression pact with Germany in order to protect peoples of the Soviet Union. Stalin, as the national leader, had to produce no war with Germany. Stalin did not have choice.\nGermany invaded Poland on September 1, so the U.K. and France decided to declare war against Germany.\nThe German Army attack in West Europe, France surrendered in 1940, and the British Army withdrew from Dunkerque.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ya-RsxcAL8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ya-RsxcAL8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ya-RsxcAL8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "UNITED NATIONS", "tags": ["WW2", "Color", "\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f", "\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f", "\u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430", "Second", "World", "War", "history", "nazism", "Hitler", "nazi", "soldier", "battle", "tank", "force", "russian", "Germany", "German", "red", "army", "the", "united", "states", "nations", "axis", "military"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Battle of Europe in 1945 - The Russian Red Army attacked on Germany - Marshal Zhukov & Rokossovsky", "description": "WW2 in Color 12/13 Part 2\n\nHistorical documents:\nhttp://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org\n\nGeneral Zhukov wrote in his memoir about WW2.\nZhukov's memoir is put on\u00a0\nhttps://archive.org\n\nIn 1930s, Japanese military threatened Europe. \nIf Japan integrated China & East Asia at the time, large military nation world appear.\nPeople of the world estimated that this military nation world be consist of 500 million people.\nSo Germany had to reinforce military in order to defend nationals from Japan.\nJapan gave Germany large anxiety.  \nThus, Japan urged appearance of militarism by fascist in Germany.\nFascist would not take power if Japan did not invade Asian countries.\nTherefore, a cause of serious militarization in Germany is Japanese invasion.\nWW2 did not occur if Japan did not aggrandize territory.\n\nTo teens:\nOf course, Germany will never invade in the future.\nThe reason is as follows:\n1.
